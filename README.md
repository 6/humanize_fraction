#=> "two and three fourths"
"2 3/4".humanize_fraction(quarter: true)
#=> "two and three quarters"
"1/1000000".humanize_fraction(shorthand: true)
#=> "a millionth"
"222/333".humanize_fraction
#=> "two hundred and twenty-two three hundred thirty-thirds"
```

If you wish to use the monkey-patched `String#humanize_fraction`, add the following into an initializer/config:

```ruby
require 'humanize_fraction'
String.include(CoreExtensions::String::HumanizeFraction)
```
